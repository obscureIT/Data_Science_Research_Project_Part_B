Call them back and tell them you want an alcohol detox, all you have to do is take a couple shots before you go in so you have measurable alcohol levels when they breathalyze you or do a urine test. This has worked for plenty of people I know. If you’re gonna stay on the Xanax no point on going thru a benzo detox while you’re there and just adding unnecessary additional discomfort.    But if you are gonna quit the Xanax, that is the proper way to detox a benzo first off, safely at least, by tapering it with a longer acting and different benzo, usually Valium or Ativan, maybe Librium, and slowly working you down and lowering your dose to prevent you from having a fatal seizure during withdrawal. When I detoxed from Xanax 12mg a day they did a 10 day rapid taper. It was not long enough. A proper benzo detox taper is several months long, but if you’re not able to do that I would do at least a month because the 10 days left me hurting. It was still definitely better than cold turkey.  Just FYI. There is no “cocaine detox” cocaine ‘withdrawal’ is completely psychological (super strong cravings, dreams, irritability, depression, fatigue, etc) so that is probably why it is not covered. You still should go to treatment though, but see if Medicare would cover it if you looked into an inpatient facility and told them you were not looking to do a detox just the rehab part because you don’t need one if you’re not quitting  the xans. But if this doesn’t work your best bet is the alcohol trick."

Beyond that, my naivety had me believing I would come out as the same person that I was prior to treatment, only minus the drug problem. Unfortunately, my arrogance had me using again almost immediately. The reality of recovery is that it requires action. Whatever process you choose (whether it’s a 12step program or any other program), you have got to be willing to take direction and change the way you think. Quitting is the easy part, learning to live your life without using substances to try and control the way you feel is the real challenge."

I've been on it for about 10 years, same dosage, same number of pills a day, I've never asked for an early refill and I try to use it judiciously. The detox is, on average, 5-7 days according to their website. Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to go into inpatient rehab after detox because I'm the sole caregiver for my disabled Mother. So, I can get away with being gone for a week but definitely not a month. After detox I was planning on going into their PHP program, which is most of the day, 5 days a week. And once I've made enough progress in PHP I'd step down to IOP. They actually wanted me to start in IOP. But I know myself and I know a medically supervised detox would be best. After about 5-6 hours without coke I turn into a miserable, angry, and overall dickish person. So, I'd rather be inpatient while I'm doing this."

         "My first detox and treatment center were corrupted by me trying to tell professionals how and to what extent I wanted to “recover”. Beyond that, my naivety had me believing I would come out as the same person that I was prior to treatment, only minus the drug problem. Unfortunately, my arrogance had me using again almost immediately. The reality of recovery is that it requires action. Whatever process you choose (whether it’s a 12step program or any other program), you have got to be willing to take direction and change the way you think. Quitting is the easy part, learning to live your life without using substances to try and control the way you feel is the real challenge.",

         "I'd stay on the Xanax long term, it's the only benzo that works for my Panic Disorder. I've been on it for about 10 years, same dosage, same number of pills a day, I've never asked for an early refill and I try to use it judiciously. The detox is, on average, 5-7 days according to their website. Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to go into inpatient rehab after detox because I'm the sole caregiver for my disabled Mother. So, I can get away with being gone for a week but definitely not a month. After detox I was planning on going into their PHP program, which is most of the day, 5 days a week. And once I've made enough progress in PHP I'd step down to IOP. They actually wanted me to start in IOP. But I know myself and I know a medically supervised detox would be best. After about 5-6 hours without coke I turn into a miserable, angry, and overall dickish person. So, I'd rather be inpatient while I'm doing this.",

         "Great job!  Let me give you some advice.  Body is filled up with stress hormones, cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. This is what’s regulate pretty much anything bad that we feel. Detox, burn outs, depression you name it.  It’s a balance between finding ways to regulate, like working out, playing something fun, doing things with friends, and so on.  It’s a balance between being strong enough to withstand the flushes of stress hormones that comes just by existing. It’s about getting stronger and stronger, so you feel it less often, less heavy, less length. Working out with cardio is your best bet. Some people NEEDS that many times a week to feel like a normal human without constant anxiety, I’m one of them.  The heavier issues the more survival mode the body goes into. The deeper the survival mode the more your brain shuts down positive feelings and emotion. The more you will get negative feelings.  Physical inactivity leads to inactive and a rough life, physical activity leads to a healthy and happy life and lifestyle. Easy enough. Doing nothing releases more stress hormones then being out walking for example.   I can recommend anyone who has addiction issues or mental health issues to go out and run on max speed every other day. 2 months from now your life will be very different.   It’s that strength and stability you build that keeps you away from partly feeling like shit from life and partly being more solid towards the feeling of using.  It’s no joke, this is the key people figure out that gives them an awesome and solid life year after year. So if anything, go out and run until you can’t move anymore. A couple of months from now when you feel better, you can focus on adding vitamines, proteins and such to build a solid recovery setup and that will take you to new levels and physical and mental health.  Active people lives very active life and it’s not a coincidence.   I was about 1 year clean when I started my training journey and I haven’t for a second thought about using since I started. This was a year ago and my life is now better then EVER in my life.",

It’s not easy being sober, and it’s not easy to feel good overall, when i’ve been down so deep the addiction stuck in the first place.  So basically you stated what everyone who uses stated, you feel better abusing.   Sadly it’s a statement that shows that your motivation is lacking and by so, you won’t be clean anytime soon. So on that matter, why would your boyfriend want to stick around when you don’t even try to take sobriety seriously? Not using is bare minimum you know.  I personally have to do heavy cardio every other day of the week, year around to keep my extreme level of anxiety away. And burning out that came from constant anxiety to stupidity high level of anxiety. At least I feel better then ever in my life. Therapy is good if you have things that could explain your use from the start. But not everyone have traumas and such that trigger addiction.   My point is: Staying sober and staying sober over time IS A LOT of work. If it wasn’t no one would relapse. Everyone needs some sort of plan and to follow through every day, and you will be less likely to fall back for every month that goes.  It’s just stress hormones running in your body in the end of the day. If you would go out and run or hit the gym u til you have no energy left, you would feel much better and less likely feel the need to use. It’s called regulating and release of negative hormones.",

Because everyone uses excuses to commit the worst and use despite love, there at least you will have nothing to reproach yourself for, you have tried your heart and the addiction is stronger despite the love you have for them, it's so hard to see the person you love destroy themselves and be powerless and that destroys you at the same time and tears your heart and soul, protect yourself and distance yourself, I know to what extent a harmful person can make you sink just by abject behavior... So addiction... Too hard to live with seeing the person destroy themselves and not being able to do anything, destiny will make you find each other if you are meant to be together otherwise, Live a good life, far from all that with someone who doesn't use, In my experience, a former user for example should get together with someone who doesn't use, or who has been abstinent for a long time, two users who have recently been recovering are at high risk of relapsing for x reasons, I have been abstinent for 10 years and would have done better to look elsewhere instead of making a fuss with someone who wants to use the devil and the hidden vice in many forms, lurking in the shadows, ready to exploit the slightest flaw, Choose your vibrational frequencies and who you want to attract to vibrate intensely and experience what you deserve, Sometimes we don't like to wallow in patterns of suffering from archaic wounds, because happiness is scary, you have to concentrate on yourself, Your being and your happiness, live and vibrate strongly and intensely...

The latter end of this progression is not something I would go through again, nor wish on another person.   They will give you saline to hydrate you, but hospitals on DXM are not enjoyable. But it may be of great help. If you feel you have a problem with drug use, they will also be able to direct you to services after your stay that can help you get the ball rolling on getting out of that mess if you so wish.   Stay safe. Much love.",
