         "Do you really want to quit Xanax or are you planning to stay on it long term? If you’re gonna stay on it, your best option is to go there for alcohol. Call them back and tell them you want an alcohol detox, all you have to do is take a couple shots before you go in so you have measurable alcohol levels when they breathalyze you or do a urine test. This has worked for plenty of people I know. If you’re gonna stay on the Xanax no point on going thru a benzo detox while you’re there and just adding unnecessary additional discomfort.    But if you are gonna quit the Xanax, that is the proper way to detox a benzo first off, safely at least, by tapering it with a longer acting and different benzo, usually Valium or Ativan, maybe Librium, and slowly working you down and lowering your dose to prevent you from having a fatal seizure during withdrawal. When I detoxed from Xanax 12mg a day they did a 10 day rapid taper. It was not long enough. A proper benzo detox taper is several months long, but if you’re not able to do that I would do at least a month because the 10 days left me hurting. It was still definitely better than cold turkey.  Just FYI. There is no “cocaine detox” cocaine ‘withdrawal’ is completely psychological (super strong cravings, dreams, irritability, depression, fatigue, etc) so that is probably why it is not covered. You still should go to treatment though, but see if Medicare would cover it if you looked into an inpatient facility and told them you were not looking to do a detox just the rehab part because you don’t need one if you’re not quitting  the xans. But if this doesn’t work your best bet is the alcohol trick.",

         "Do you really want to quit Xanax or are you planning to stay on it long term? If you’re gonna stay on it, your best option is to go there for alcohol. Call them back and tell them you want an alcohol detox, all you have to do is take a couple shots before you go in so you have measurable alcohol levels when they breathalyze you or do a urine test. This has worked for plenty of people I know. If you’re gonna stay on the Xanax no point on going thru a benzo detox while you’re there and just adding unnecessary additional discomfort.    But if you are gonna quit the Xanax, that is the proper way to detox a benzo first off, safely at least, by tapering it with a longer acting and different benzo, usually Valium or Ativan, maybe Librium, and slowly working you down and lowering your dose to prevent you from having a fatal seizure during withdrawal. When I detoxed from Xanax 12mg a day they did a 10 day rapid taper. It was not long enough. A proper benzo detox taper is several months long, but if you’re not able to do that I would do at least a month because the 10 days left me hurting. It was still definitely better than cold turkey.  Just FYI. There is no “cocaine detox” cocaine ‘withdrawal’ is completely psychological (super strong cravings, dreams, irritability, depression, fatigue, etc) so that is probably why it is not covered. You still should go to treatment though, but see if Medicare would cover it if you looked into an inpatient facility and told them you were not looking to do a detox just the rehab part because you don’t need one if you’re not quitting  the xans. But if this doesn’t work your best bet is the alcohol trick."

         "01-01-2024",
         "every year around this time i get a huge existential crisis which makes me anxious and overly emotional. currently i've lost my appetite and feel empty. at some point i get over my existential crisis and my anxiety about dying and my family dying but due to the fact it occurs every year around the same time leads me to think that i should communicate my issues to a professional.there have been other instances in my life where i also cut off people in my life and become a shut-in by not communicating my own issues to the people around me, and i think it'd be best for me to begin trying to get better at communication. a therapist would probably help with this but i've had a therapist before and i found that after the first session that i found it hard to actually vocalise my issues, but in these instances that are unrelated to my yearly existential crises, these were cycles of me bottling up my feelings and then upon irrationally acting on these feelings that i find myself not bothered by them anymore.\nhello and welcome.reaching out for professional support takes courage. a therapist can help provide tools in many instances. don't be discouraged if opening up is difficult at first - it often takes time to build trust and feel comfortable sharing deeply. one thing you could try is to write down your thoughts when they arise and show the written words to the therapist at the time you see them? this is something i have had to do. also, commend you for recognizing these patterns and seeking help to break them. wishing you all the best in your healing journey and if you want to chat more, i'm listening...\nthanks for the support. i'll take your advice to heart.\nit can be hard at first finding a psychologist you feel right with … it doesn’t need to be perfect but it is easier with someone your comfortable with. i think it would definitely be beneficial to nut this over with a professional for sure as maybe they can help you pick apart what happening during these crisis for you. they may have some valid suggestions… i mean nothing ventured, nothing gained right.hang in there buddy\nburntlibraryofalexandria,thank you for posting here, and welcome to the forums. i'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with anxiety.those thoughts that you've described are often called intrusive thoughts, but they can be quite derailing and pervasive sometimes. with regards to these, a therapist may be useful to help you work through these, recognise where they may be coming from, and help to alleviate the distress that they can induce.with regards to communication, i have several suggestions based on my own experiences. sure, a therapist may be able to help you with communication. but i also believe that communication can be improved by listening to and learning from other people who communicate well. you can find youtube videos and tutorials on how to be a better communicator or a better listener. particularly with ted talks, they're not only useful for helping to improve different skills but they're also thoroughly entertaining. listening to videos or podcasts by psychologists or people who have experienced significant traumas in their lives can also give you insight into certain feelings or experiences to help you communicate yours.i also think that reading a lot can help you to better communicate your thoughts and how you're feeling. you get to learn different ways of phrasing things, or different terms for different states of mind. it can also be helpful for anxiety, as reading has the power to transport you to another world for a little while. you get to disconnect from reality and put yourself in a different setting where characters and/or real-life people have different struggles and life situations, which can broaden your world view and subsequently also help you with communicating your own struggles.i hope this helps. i may have gotten a little carried away with my perspective on why reading is a useful tool, but the general point still stands. please feel free to continue chatting with us, we'd love to hear more from you if you'd be willing to share.take care, sb\nthank you for the advice and the support. i'm definitely planning on seeing a therapist or psychologist some time about my issues now.\nthanks for replying to my post. the response that i've gotten on here has really helped me. thanks for offering some alternatives to a therapist based on your own experiences, it really helps showing the options i have and the things that i am able to do in times where i feel helpless.",

         "i'm wondering if anyone else feels like this? i had a really positive outlook for 2024 about a week ago, but now it's completely changed.2023 for really hard for me and my fiance. there were so many things we had to overcome: i had to take my ex to court to get parental orders, my car kept breaking down and i was struggling to get a new one, my partner's visa, my adhd assessment. it was just one thing after another. there were a lot of ways they all could have gone wrong, and every time we had the best possible outcome. so by the end of it, i was feeling really proud of what we had accomplished. i was feeling like now all of those things were out of the way, i had nothing to worry about anymore.new years day always feels like a clean slate to me. in some ways that's a good thing, but it just feels like nothing i did last year matters. i know time doesn't really work like that, it's just a feeling i struggle to shake. there are so many things that could go wrong this year.it also doesn't help that i'm missing my son's birthday again today. last year it was because i was being denied access, this year it's because i have covid.i often feel like this about new years, but it's not usually this bad.anyway, does anyone else ever feel this way about this time of year?\nk-j-swelcome to the forum.i find i feel pressured to be happy at new year and needing to change and organised. i have had a challenging last few months with my physical health.can you work you take each day of the new year one day at a time.?\nhi k-j-si find there can be a lot of mixed emotions regarding the new year, as well as the year left behind. can be so hard to make sense of it all at times, which can really start to mess with perspective and mental health. i think what helps me manage better understanding, when it comes to why and how i think and feel the way i do, comes from a book by jamie catto, called 'insanely gifted - turn your demons into creative rocket fuel'. he offers the idea that we are multifaceted in nature, therefor our different natures can be triggered to life under different circumstances. so, while the optimist in me may be insisting 'this new year is going to be filled with achievements like never before', when the new year actuallydoescome in, cue the stresser, pessimist or some other part of me. i imagine it sounds weird but there could be what resembles an entire play going on, with a number of different facets playing out at once. with the old saying 'to be in 2 minds', could actually be in 5 minds at once, going from positive to negative to more negative and back to positive etc. if you imagine the players (with very different dialogue and differentfeelto them)...the optimist: next year is going to be filled with even greater achievementsthe pessimist: but where did last yearreallyget you? what was it all for? what was the point?the stresser: what if next year is evenmorestressful. it could be unbearablethe sage: everything will be fine. itwillbe challenging but in the end there will be an evengreatersense of achievement. so, what's the plan? for a start, there has to be a good routine as a solid foundation to work fromthe pessimist and the stresser(in unison): but routines don't work!and on it goes. while it appears i missed one, that would bethe director. without a director in us, some disciplinarian keeping our multifaceted nature in check, some facets can get completely out of control and take over as 'the main character'. take the harsh inner critic for example, it can play out for days on end or even years on end in some cases. it can be depressing, horrible, cruel and more. 'you're hopeless. nothing you do matters. you think you're achieving great things but you're kidding yourself'. a nasty depressing facet of self, for sure, and even soul destroying in some ways (one of those so called 'inner demons').i suppose it's about choosing our 'players'consciously. for example, if we choosethe optimist,the visionary/seerandthe adventurerin us, to worktogetherin constructive ways, there'll be no choice but toseethe next greatpositive adventure. if it's about making a new financial investment, that may involvethe financial manager, the visionary/seerandthe analystin us and maybe a bit of ourintuitive self(when it comes to getting afeelfor the best investment/s). all players need a cue (a trigger). whether the cue or trigger is a holiday brochure or a financial investment guide book for beginners, every facet needs a prompt, prompting it to come to life. of course it's all just theory, that we have a multifaceted nature but the question remains 'can such a theory work in our favour?'. only one way to find out.",

         "i feel like i need some support from people in the know, my family is amazing but i'm not sure they understand just how hard 2023 was for me, kinda feeling like i need some kind words & reassurance that i've got this.in 2023 i experienced housing instability, bullied by a so called friend,  bullied by an employee, burnout at work and 6 months ago i also took on the main carer role for my elderly parents moving into a large house together....oh, and i have gad as well.knowing i wasn't right i quit my management role, and though i didn't plan on finding a new job so quickly have found something perfect for me with great hours and no major pressures which i start soon. it'll mean being careful with expenses but i'm not worried about that, i can do it.i guess my question is what else do i need to do? how do i set aside the nastiness of 2023 that's playing on my mind? is my complete career change going to be enough to heal? what other steps can i take to feel like i'm the person i want to be?\ndear more than...~welcome here ot the support forum. i think you are already showing by your actions you are close to seeing you are the person you want to be.you are a caring person, if you were not you would think of taking on that very demanding role with  oyur elderly parents.you are also someone who takes action. going from a job that had become toxic rather than just putting up with it shows courage, an ability to face the unknown, and where bullying is concerned know that ceasing contact rather than fighting or putting up with it is the wisest course of action.you are also lucky, not something to be easily dismissed, with housing problems solved and a new better job popping up when you need it.i guess htere are still a couple of things to consider, the first is what action you think is appropriate with that bullying so called friend? is the relationship something that can be worked out?the other is your anxiety condition. i have htat too and found that there were a combination of things  i needed to do to lessen it. medical help was there wiht meds and therapy, as was family support.may i ask if you have a family member or friend to support you? trying to shoulder everything by yourself is extra hard. just having someone to listen and give a new perspective is so helpful , i rely upon my partner to tone down my anxiety when i worry excessively about what might happen.life-style with nutrition, exercise, good rest and interaction with others helps, and there is in fact a thread where many have set down what has helped them -it's long but i've found a lot there to assist me:https skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant /forums.beyondblue.org.au/t5/anxiety/self-help-tips-for-managing-anxiety/m-p/50482#m7636finally please do not take on too much wiht your parents, it is simply impossible for one person to look after one, let alone two, people as a carer. get help - professional help if the are entitled to it - and also use respite. pace yourself for the long haulcroix\nthe warmest of welcomes to youyou're an incredible person who's done an incredible job when it comes to managing last year. you've managed through so much stress, so much challenge and here you are determined to manage the path ahead in new ways. i think we don't always realise where our tipping point isuntilwe meet with it and when we do, it can feel overwhelming, unbelievably stressful and even depressing in some ways. so, now to tip the scales in a way that reflects a sense of balance (between challenge and wellbeing).finding out what government funded support services are available to your parents, under the circumstances, could be a start. i mention 'under the circumstances' based on the fact you're living with them, therefor they're notentirelyliving independently. also, in the process you could find out whether you're entitled to any form of carers allowance, playing a live in role in their lives. the more your parents are supported through everyday assistance, the less time you need to take out of your life to support them when it comes to the basics. it's about freeing up time foryouchoosing what forms of self development you'd like to explore could be another thing for the new year. for example, if you want to focus on how your mind, body and emotions all work together,yogacould be a new thing. if you want to work on calming your nervous system through your imagination, joining aguided meditationgroup could be a possibility while introducing you to people with a similar interest. perhaps some online research could make a difference. researching stuff like 'the 3rd stage of general adaptation syndrome (gas)' could be one area of research (which has a tipping point factor to it, related to ongoing stress). the vagus nerve could be another area of research: how it interacts with the nervous system, how to strengthen it, how to have it function more efficiently etc. or you could go down a more soulful path or what some may call 'woo woo', exploring the challenges of being an 'empath' or someone who's 'clairsentient' (clear feeling), which becomes about exploringthe ability to feelandhow to manage the ability tofeeljust about everything, including other people's emotions on top of your own. btw, i'm a bit of a woo woo gal myself who tried yoga for the first time in my 53 years early last year after having reached my tipping point. it was part of my path to recovery. it was one on one with a teacher. in one session that involved focusing on bringing love and joy into myself, i burst out crying while realising love and joy were things i gave to others but not to myself. yoga can come with a lot of emotional revelations and releasesfrom the way forward for your parents when it comes to added support all the way through to your own self development (personal evolution), no rush. even if your only focus remains on easing your way into your new job (congrats, btw) go with that. go with what youfeelneeds to be your only focus for now. you're a beautiful, amazing, caring, deeply feeling incredible person who deserves the time, opportunity and support when it comes to developing into who you are on the verge of becoming after having manged last year.",

         "hi everyone,i wonder if anyone has overcome the tendancy of being passive agressive rather than expressing anger?when i have conflict with others, i tend initially, to try to understand their point of view then, usually when i'm alone, i begin to feel angry and will often verbalise what i would like to have said to the person. but i'm too afraid of expressing my anger to others in case i panic and forget what i want to say or begin to shake and burst into tears.i really want to change this behaviour and learn to express ny anger more appropriately.any suggestions would be most welcome.regardsrichju\nhi richju,i understand what you are saying, if we have not learned how to express our anger, or in my case, not allowed to express our anger, it can be really hard to control all the emotion involved in the moment.one solution could be to take time out at that moment to allow yourself to find a calmer state and come back to the conversation when you are not so emotionally volatile. another solution could be to take time out and write down your thoughts and feelings for the other person to read when you are feeling calmer so that you don't have to worry about forgetting what you wanted to express.when we are feeling emotionally volatile and vulnerable, we can blurt out all sorts of things which can often be taken the wrong way, better for both parties to agree to allow the situation to de-escalate in order to have a conversation rather than an argument. arguments rarely resolve anything, but a heartfelt conversation can resolve a great deal.i hope this is of some help,indigo\nhi richjui have to say good on you for 1)recognising the passive aggression, 2)wanting to make sense of it and 3)wanting to change your approach to things.personally, i came to realise my passive aggression comes from my intolerant sense of self. with the idea that we're multifaceted, imagine there's an intolerant facet to us, a people pleaser facet to us, an analytical facet and a sage-like facet, just to name a handful. so, if i set the scene by leading you to imagine some self righteous arrogant self obsessed relative says to you, while laughing (to make things worse), 'no, you're hopeless at that. there's no way you can achieve it, no matter how much you kid yourself' cuethe intolerant facet: 'they can't say that, that's horrible. don't tolerate that sh**' which can trigger...the inner sage: 'you need to calm down andthinkabout what leads them to say it' which triggers...the analyst: it's based on the idea they simply have no vision. don't take it personally. they simply can't see beyond themself, that'stheir nature. they're completely self focused' which can potentially enrage/trigger...the intolerant facet: 'who gives a damn about the reason' whichcanset off...the people pleaser: don't upset anyone!so, the middle ground between complete intolerance and people pleasing is passive aggression. it's not brutal but it's also not completely pleasing or pleasant. but it may not end there. on our own, there's the chance for our intolerant facet to start up again, 'you're hopeless. you should have said something. you should have set a boundary for them toneveroverstep again. instead you aimed to please and didn't entirely stand up for yourself. next time, donottolerate a damn thing from that person!'.my intolerant sense of self is typically fueled by anger. the more angry i become, the more intense it gets. works the other way around too. if i want to channel my intolerant facet to life, for one reason or another, i'll work up to anger which tends to trigger it. i know someone else who does the same exercise, generating a sense of anger so as totriggerthat really upstanding part of our self that sets boundaries. such an exercise has to be done carefully, so it doesn't create ahuge level of energy(aka absolute fury) that produces shaking, out of control rants and the kind of dialogue that burns bridges. definitely a challenging facet to manage but one that can help generate greater levels of self-esteem. whether certain facets of us are gradually triggered to life over time or they come to life in a 'zero to a thousand kms a second' scenario (afuriousand out of control rate), the speed definitely has afeelto it. btw, if it wasn't for my inner sage, i would have burned many a bridge over time. it's the part that insists on reasoning (a wise and reasonable part of us), that helps manage intolerance. sometimes it can also be about getting the people pleaser in us to take a back seat more often, so that it doesn't remain our driving force, letting us down or even bringing us down in a number of ways.\ndear indigo and therising,thank you both for your replies. i did manage to express my anger in writing. i felt it was a bit of a cop out to do it that way but better than nothing and i felt calmer once i'd done it.writing it down helped me to marshall my thoughts and to avoid too much blaming.unfortunately the conflict was with my neighbour, who is very much a pleaser and things are still a bit uncomfortable between us. hower, she rectified the breach and i thanked her for this.i always experience some guilt after expressing my anger and i'm aware of how that guilt originated. i became very ill as a child and nearly died so my mum spoilt me after that. however, she made me feel guilty for being spoilt and would lay on the guilt if i became angry with her.as i'm nearly 73, i think it's about time i got over this and allowed the occasionally angry me some free reign!again, thank you both for your most useful and encouraging replies.richju xxxxxxx\nhi again richju,you are most welcome and i am glad to hear that it was helpful to you.you seem to be a self aware person, knowing what is at the root of your inability to easily express your anger. i had a similar problem with my mother, everyone in my dysfunctional family were angry and i soaked up all the anger being the sensitive child. being angry was not an option for me, all it did was make my dad angry and my mum would take it as a personal attack and cry, telling me how awful i was to her. so i kept it down all my life until they passed and spent the following 2 years in a rage, everything i bottled up came out in one go.i am thinking that writing in a journal daily or when you have something on your mind, could be a good process for you. it might help you with your expression and understanding of your emotions. i have done this at different times in my life and it can be very beneficial.i wish you all the best,indigo\nthanks indigo,your mum sounds similar to mine in her reaction to anger but i suppose they both had their own issues and weren't lucky as us to be able to access this forum.writing is my main hobby and i've begun writing about my mum a lot recently. she had a very difficult life and i loved her but there were many times that i didn't like her. my elder son seems to feel the same way about me now.thanks again indigo - it's a beautiful colour and you seem to have a beautiful nature.love and hugs,richju xxxxxxxxxx\nhi richjui'm so glad some degree of resolution was reached with your neighbour. whether it involves neighbours or family members, people are interesting in their nature. we can be interesting too, when it comes to being able to make greater sense of how we think, feel and behave. naturevsnurture and all that. what makes us who we are? what leads us to feel guilt? the list ofquestions seems never ending at times, in that almightyquestto truly know our self. writing can be such good therapy at times.guilt is an interesting one. while i used to resent it, now i try to see it as a trusted friend that likes to lead me to a greater sense of consciousness. when i feel the presence of guilt, i imagine it asks me 'who do you wish to be in this moment or from this moment onward?'. for example, do i wish to be someone who apologises for having allowed myself to lose control (if that is the case) or do i wish to be someone who acknowledges my choice to speak my mind, free of the reigns that hold me back from fully expressing my overwhelming pain and my deep heartfelt needs? guilt raises me, based on it raising my consciousness. i think when it triggers our inner critic, the people pleaser in us or some other part of us that leads us to sufferance in some way, then it's notguilt in its most helpful form. i find, if someoneleads meto feel guilt, i have to be careful it's not actually shame they're leading me to or that they're not manipulating me in a way that brings some self loathing part of me to life, to suit their own agenda.\nhi again therisinng and thanks for your thoughtfull reply.i've been thinking about people pleasers lately and wonder if deep down they are actually self haters. i have noticed they tend to avoid looking into themselves too closely and seem to function in a 'please like me mode' to boost their self esteem, therefore social media seems to appeal to them. it must be difficult to maintain this 'nice' persona.vive the individual i say! the one who can voice their needs and feel comfortable doing this at the risk of being disliked.let's have some healthy honesty here and rid ourselves of this guilt rubbish eh?i feel that 2024 will be a year of good personal growth.love and honesty to all!richju xxxxx",

         "hi everyone,i wonder if anyone has overcome the tendancy of being passive agressive rather than expressing anger?when i have conflict with others, i tend initially, to try to understand their point of view then, usually when i'm alone, i begin to feel angry and will often verbalise what i would like to have said to the person. but i'm too afraid of expressing my anger to others in case i panic and forget what i want to say or begin to shake and burst into tears.i really want to change this behaviour and learn to express ny anger more appropriately.any suggestions would be most welcome.regardsrichju\nhi richju,i understand what you are saying, if we have not learned how to express our anger, or in my case, not allowed to express our anger, it can be really hard to control all the emotion involved in the moment.one solution could be to take time out at that moment to allow yourself to find a calmer state and come back to the conversation when you are not so emotionally volatile. another solution could be to take time out and write down your thoughts and feelings for the other person to read when you are feeling calmer so that you don't have to worry about forgetting what you wanted to express.when we are feeling emotionally volatile and vulnerable, we can blurt out all sorts of things which can often be taken the wrong way, better for both parties to agree to

'you're hopeless. nothing you do matters. you think you're achieving great things but you're kidding yourself'. a nasty depressing facet of self, for sure, and even soul destroying in some ways (one of those so called 'inner demons').i suppose it's about choosing our 'players'consciously. for example, if we choosethe optimist,the visionary/seerandthe adventurerin us, to worktogetherin constructive ways, there'll be no choice but toseethe next greatpositive adventure. if it's about making a new financial investment, that may involvethe financial manager, the visionary/seerandthe analystin us and maybe a bit of ourintuitive self(when it comes to getting afeelfor the best investment/s). all players need a cue (a trigger). whether the cue or trigger is a holiday brochure or a financial investment guide book for beginners, every facet needs a prompt, prompting it to come to life. of course it's all just theory, that we have a multifaceted nature but the question remains 'can such a theory work in our favour?'. only one way to find out."

is the relationship something that can be worked out?the other is your anxiety condition. i have htat too and found that there were a combination of things  i needed to do to lessen it. medical help was there wiht meds and therapy, as was family support.may i ask if you have a family member or friend to support you? trying to shoulder everything by yourself is extra hard. just having someone to listen and give a new perspective is so helpful , i rely upon my partner to tone down my anxiety when i worry excessively about what might happen.life-style with nutrition, exercise, good rest and interaction with others helps, and there is in fact a thread where many have set down what has helped them -it's long but i've found a lot there to assist me:https skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant /forums.beyondblue.org.au/t5/anxiety/self-help-tips-for-managing-anxiety/m-p/50482#m7636finally please do not take on too much wiht your parents, it is simply impossible for one person to look after one, let alone two, people as a carer. get help - professional help if the are entitled to it - and also use respite. pace yourself for the long haulcroix\nthe warmest of welcomes to youyou're an incredible person who's done an incredible job when it comes to managing last year. you've managed through so much stress, so much challenge and here you are determined to manage the path ahead in new ways. i think we don't always realise where our tipping point isuntilwe meet with it and when we do, it can feel overwhelming, unbelievably stressful and even depressing in some ways. so, now to tip the scales in a way that reflects a sense of balance (between challenge and wellbeing).finding out what government funded support services are available to your parents, under the circumstances, could be a start. i mention 'under the circumstances' based on the fact you're living with them, therefor they're notentirelyliving independently. also, in the process you could find out whether you're entitled to any form of carers allowance, playing a live in role in their lives. the more your parents are supported through everyday assistance, the less time you need to take out of your life to support them when it comes to the basics. it's about freeing up time foryouchoosing what forms of self development you'd like to explore could be another thing for the new year. for example, if you want to focus on how your mind, body and emotions all work together,yogacould be a new thing. if you want to work on calming your nervous system through your imagination, joining aguided meditationgroup could be a possibility while introducing you to people with a similar interest. perhaps some online research could make a difference. researching stuff like 'the 3rd stage of general adaptation syndrome (gas)' could be one area of research (which has a tipping point factor to it, related to ongoing stress). the vagus nerve could be another area of research: how it interacts with the nervous system, how to strengthen it, how to have it function more efficiently etc. or you could go down a more soulful path or what some may call 'woo woo', exploring the challenges of being an 'empath' or someone who's 'clairsentient' (clear feeling), which becomes about exploringthe ability to feelandhow to manage the ability tofeeljust about everything, including other people's emotions on top of your own. btw, i'm a bit of a woo woo gal myself who tried yoga for the first time in my 53 years early last year after having reached my tipping point. it was part of my path to recovery. it was one on one with a teacher. in one session that involved focusing on bringing love and joy into myself, i burst out crying while realising love and joy were things i gave to others but not to myself. yoga can come with a lot of emotional revelations and releasesfrom the way forward for your parents when it comes to added support all the way through to your own self development (personal evolution), no rush. even if your only focus remains on easing your way into your new job (congrats, btw) go with that. go with what youfeelneeds to be your only focus for now. you're a beautiful, amazing, caring, deeply feeling incredible person who deserves the time, opportunity and support when it comes to developing into who you are on the verge of becoming after having manged last year."

         "hi everyone,i wonder if anyone has overcome the tendancy of being passive agressive rather than expressing anger?when i have conflict with others, i tend initially, to try to understand their point of view then, usually when i'm alone, i begin to feel angry and will often verbalise what i would like to have said to the person. but i'm too afraid of expressing my anger to others in case i panic and forget what i want to say or begin to shake and burst into tears.i really want to change this behaviour and learn to express ny anger more appropriately.any suggestions would be most welcome.regardsrichju\nhi richju,i understand what you are saying, if we have not learned how to express our anger, or in my case, not allowed to express our anger, it can be really hard to control all the emotion involved in the moment.one solution could be to take time out at that moment to allow yourself to find a calmer state and come back to the conversation when you are not so emotionally volatile. another solution could be to take time out and write down your thoughts and feelings for the other person to read when you are feeling calmer so that you don't have to worry about forgetting what you wanted to express.when we are feeling emotionally volatile and vulnerable, we can blurt out all sorts of things which can often be taken the wrong way, better for both parties to agree to allow the situation to de-escalate in order to have a conversation rather than an argument. arguments rarely resolve anything, but a heartfelt conversation can resolve a great deal.i hope this is of some help,indigo\nhi richjui have to say good on you for 1)recognising the passive aggression, 2)wanting to make sense of it and 3)wanting to change your approach to things.personally, i came to realise my passive aggression comes from my intolerant sense of self. with the idea that we're multifaceted, imagine there's an intolerant facet to us, a people pleaser facet to us, an analytical facet and a sage-like facet, just to name a handful. so, if i set the scene by leading you to imagine some self righteous arrogant self obsessed relative says to you, while laughing (to make things worse), 'no, you're hopeless at that. there's no way you can achieve it, no matter how much you kid yourself' cuethe intolerant facet: 'they can't say that, that's horrible. don't tolerate that sh**' which can trigger...the inner sage: 'you need to calm down andthinkabout what leads them to say it' which triggers...the analyst: it's based on the idea they simply have no vision. don't take it personally. they simply can't see beyond themself, that'stheir nature. they're completely self focused' which can potentially enrage/trigger...the intolerant facet: 'who gives a damn about the reason' whichcanset off...the people pleaser: don't upset anyone!so, the middle ground between complete intolerance and people pleasing is passive aggression. it's not brutal but it's also not completely pleasing or pleasant. but it may not end there. on our own, there's the chance for our intolerant facet to start up again, 'you're hopeless. you should have said something. you should have set a boundary for them toneveroverstep again. instead you aimed to please and didn't entirely stand up for yourself. next time, donottolerate a damn thing from that person!'.my intolerant sense of self is typically fueled by anger. the more angry i become, the more intense it gets. works the other way around too. if i want to channel my intolerant facet to life, for one reason or another, i'll work up to anger which tends to trigger it. i know someone else who does the same exercise, generating a sense of anger so as totriggerthat really upstanding part of our self that sets boundaries. such an exercise has to be done carefully, so it doesn't create ahuge level of energy(aka absolute fury) that produces shaking, out of control rants and the kind of dialogue that burns bridges. definitely a challenging facet to manage but one that can help generate greater levels of self-esteem. whether certain facets of us are gradually triggered to life over time or they come to life in a 'zero to a thousand kms a second' scenario (afuriousand out of control rate), the speed definitely has afeelto it. btw, if it wasn't for my inner sage, i would have burned many a bridge over time. it's the part that insists on reasoning (a wise and reasonable part of us), that helps manage intolerance. sometimes it can also be about getting the people pleaser in us to take a back seat more often, so that it doesn't remain our driving force, letting us down or even bringing us down in a number of ways.\ndear indigo and therising,thank you both for your replies. i did manage to express my anger in writing. i felt it was a bit of a cop out to do it that way but better than nothing and i felt calmer once i'd done it.writing it down helped me to marshall my thoughts and to avoid too much blaming.unfortunately the conflict was with my neighbour, who is very much a pleaser and things are still a bit uncomfortable between us. hower, she rectified the breach and i thanked her for this.i always experience some guilt after expressing my anger and i'm aware of how that guilt originated. i became very ill as a child and nearly died so my mum spoilt me after that. however, she made me feel guilty for being spoilt and would lay on the guilt if i became angry with her.as i'm nearly 73, i think it's about time i got over this and allowed the occasionally angry me some free reign!again, thank you both for your most useful and encouraging replies.richju xxxxxxx\nhi again richju,you are most welcome and i am glad to hear that it was helpful to you.you seem to be a self aware person, knowing what is at the root of your inability to easily express your anger. i had a similar problem with my mother, everyone in my dysfunctional family were angry and i soaked up all the anger being the sensitive child. being angry was not an option for me, all it did was make my dad angry and my mum would take it as a personal attack and cry, telling me how awful i was to her. so i kept it down all my life until they passed and spent the following 2 years in a rage, everything i bottled up came out in one go.i am thinking that writing in a journal daily or when you have something on your mind, could be a good process for you. it might help you with your expression and understanding of your emotions. i have done this at different times in my life and it can be very beneficial.i wish you all the best,indigo\nthanks indigo,your mum sounds similar to mine in her reaction to anger but i suppose they both had their own issues and weren't lucky as us to be able to

         "hi everyone,i wonder if anyone has overcome the tendancy of being passive agressive rather than expressing anger?when i have conflict with others, i tend initially, to try to understand their point of view then, usually when i'm alone, i begin to feel angry and will often verbalise what i would like to have said to the person. but i'm too afraid of expressing my anger to others in case i panic and forget what i want to say or begin to shake and burst into tears.i really want to change this behaviour and learn to express ny anger more appropriately.any suggestions would be most welcome.regardsrichju\nhi richju,i understand what you are saying, if we have not learned how to express our anger, or in my case, not allowed to express our anger, it can be really hard to control all the emotion involved in the moment.one solution could be to take time out at that moment to allow yourself to find a calmer state and come back to the conversation when you are not so emotionally volatile. another solution could be to take time out and write down your thoughts and feelings for the other person to read when you are feeling calmer so that you don't have to worry about forgetting what you wanted to express.when we are feeling emotionally volatile and vulnerable, we can blurt out all sorts of things which can often be taken the wrong way, better for both parties to agree to allow the situation to de-escalate in order to have a conversation rather than an argument. arguments rarely resolve anything, but a heartfelt conversation can resolve a great deal.i hope this is of some help,indigo\nhi richjui have to say good on you for 1)recognising the passive aggression, 2)wanting to make sense of it and 3)wanting to change your approach to things.personally, i came to realise my passive aggression comes from my intolerant sense of self. with the idea that we're multifaceted, imagine there's an intolerant facet to us, a people pleaser facet to us, an analytical facet and a sage-like facet, just to name a handful. so, if i set the scene by leading you to imagine some self righteous arrogant self obsessed relative says to you, while laughing (to make things worse), 'no, you're hopeless at that. there's no way you can achieve it, no matter how much you kid yourself' cuethe intolerant facet: 'they can't say that, that's horrible. don't tolerate that sh**' which can trigger...the inner sage: 'you need to calm down andthinkabout what leads them to say it' which triggers...the analyst: it's based on the idea they simply have no vision. don't take it personally. they simply can't see beyond themself, that'stheir nature. they're completely self focused' which can potentially enrage/trigger...the intolerant facet: 'who gives a damn about the reason' whichcanset off...the people pleaser: don't upset anyone!so, the middle ground between complete intolerance and people pleasing is passive aggression. it's not brutal but it's also not completely pleasing or pleasant. but it may not end there. on our own, there's the chance for our intolerant facet to start up again, 'you're hopeless. you should have said something. you should have set a boundary for them toneveroverstep again. instead you aimed to please and didn't entirely stand up for yourself. next time, donottolerate a damn thing from that person!'.my intolerant sense of self is

         "Do you really want to quit Xanax or are you planning to stay on it long term? If you’re gonna stay on it, your best option is to go there for alcohol. Call them back and tell them you want an alcohol detox, all you have to do is take a couple shots before you go in so you have measurable alcohol levels when they breathalyze you or do a urine test. This has worked for plenty of people I know. If you’re gonna stay on the Xanax no point on going thru a benzo detox while you’re there and just adding unnecessary additional discomfort.    But if you are gonna quit the Xanax, that is the proper way to detox a benzo first off, safely at least, by tapering it with a longer acting and different benzo, usually Valium or Ativan, maybe Librium, and slowly working you down and lowering your dose to prevent you from having a fatal seizure during withdrawal. When I detoxed from Xanax 12mg a day they did a 10 day rapid taper. It was not long enough. A proper benzo detox taper is several months long, but if you’re not able to do that I would do at least a month because the 10 days left me hurting. It was still definitely better than cold turkey.  Just FYI. There is no “cocaine detox” cocaine ‘withdrawal’ is completely psychological (super strong cravings, dreams, irritability, depression, fatigue, etc) so that is probably why it is not covered. You still should go to treatment though, but see if Medicare would cover it if you looked into an inpatient facility and told them you were not looking to do a detox just the rehab part because you don’t need one if you’re not quitting  the xans. But if this doesn’t work your best bet is the alcohol trick."
